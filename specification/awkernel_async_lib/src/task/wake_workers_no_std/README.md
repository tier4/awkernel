# Sleep and Notification

This is the no_std version of [wake_workers](../wake_workers).

In `run_main()` function of `awkernel_async_lib`,
worker threads will sleep until a task is woken up.
In such case, the worker threads must be woken up to execute the task.
To achieve this, Awkernel implements `awkernel_lib::cpu::sleep_cpu()` and
`awkernel_async_lib::task::wake_workers()`.

This is a model of the above implementation.
We prepare `WORKERS` worker threads and `WORKERS + 1` tasks in this model.
To test notification works correctly,
we prepare up to `WORKERS - 1` blocking tasks.

For example, if `WORKERS` is 3, two worker threads will be blocked
but one worker thread will execute tasks as follows.

1. worker thread 3: execute and block
2. worker thread 1: execute and block
3. worker thread 2: sleep
4. a task becomes ready to run
5. primary CPU: wake up worker thread 1
6. worker thread 1: execute a task

## Targets

- [awkernel_lib/src/cpu/sleep_cpu_no_std.rs](../../../../../awkernel_lib/src/cpu/sleep_cpu_no_std.rs).
- [awkernel_lib/src/interrupt.rs](../../../../../awkernel_lib/src/interrupt.rs).
- [awkernel_async_lib/src/task.rs](../../../../../awkernel_async_lib/src/task.rs).
- [kernel/src/main.rs](../../../../../kernel/src/main.rs).

## Subjects to be Verified

1. When tasks are more than workers, all tasks will be eventually executes.
2. When CPU is woken up, it will wake up eventually.
