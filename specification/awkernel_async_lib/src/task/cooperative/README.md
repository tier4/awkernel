# Cooperative Multitasking

## Targets

- [awkernel_async_lib/src/task.rs](../../../../../awkernel_async_lib/src/task.rs).
- [awkernel_async_lib/src/scheduler/fifo.rs](../../../../../awkernel_async_lib/src/scheduler/fifo.rs).

## Subjects to be Verified

1. The scheduler is deadlock- and starvation-free.
2. If a task is awakened by other task, the task will be eventually executed.

Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 4.0E-10
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 5.4E-9
171137 states generated, 87128 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 178.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 2 and the 95th percentile is 2).

## Variables

Variables are straightly defined as follows.

```
\* awkernel_async_lib::scheduler::fifo::FIFOData::queue
queue = <<>>;

\* lock variables
lock_info = [x \in 1..TASK_NUM |-> FALSE];
lock_future = [x \in 1..TASK_NUM |-> FALSE];
lock_scheduler = FALSE;

\* awkernel_async_lib::task::State
state = [x \in 1..TASK_NUM |-> "Ready"];

is_terminated = [x \in 1..TASK_NUM |-> FALSE];

result_next = [x \in WORKERS |-> -1]; \* return value of get_next
result_future = [x \in WORKERS |-> ""]; \* return value of future

\* Does a task whose id > TASK_NUM \div 2 wakes nother task up?
wake_other = [x \in ((TASK_NUM \div 2) + 1)..TASK_NUM |-> FALSE];
```

`result_next` and `result_future` are variable to be stored of results of
`get_next` and `future` procedures, respectively.

Each entry of `state` must be `Ready`, `Waiting`, `Runnable`, `Running`, `Panicked`,
or `Terminated`, as `task::State` defined in `task.rs`, as follows.
`Panicked` state is omitted in this verification
because it is almost equivalent to `Terminated`,
and `Preempted` state is also omitted because this verification is for cooperative multitask.

```rust
pub enum State {
    Ready,
    Running,
    Runnable,
    Waiting,
    Preempted,
    Terminated,
    Panicked,
}
```

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Ready-->Runnable;
    Running-->Preempted-->Running;
    Running-->Terminated;
    Running-->Panicked;
    Running-->Waiting-->Runnable-->Running;
```

Note that this specification does not deal with `Panicked` and `Preempted` states.

## Starvation-free

The starvation-free can be verified as follows.

$$
\forall x \in 1..\mathrm{TASK\_NUM}: (\mathrm{state}[x] = \mathtt{Runnable} \leadsto \mathrm{state}[x] = \mathtt{Running})
$$

## Must be Awaken

The following paired tasks are prepared to verify that if a task is awakened by another task, the task will eventually be executed.

```rust
async fn task_a() {
    send_to_task_b().await;
    recv().await;
}

async fn task_b() {
    recv().await;
    send_to_task_b().await;
}
```

Tasks will awaken each other as follows.

```text
\* If there is 2 tasks, their task ID's are 1 and 2.
\* This future will execute as follows.
\*
\* step1: Task 2 wakes Task 1 up, and returns "Pending".
\* step2: Task 1 wakes Task 2 up, and returns "Ready".
\* step3: Task 2 returns "Ready".
\*
\* A task will become "Terminated", after returning "Ready".
procedure future(pid, task)
begin
    start_future:
        if task > TASK_NUM \div 2 then
            if wake_other[task] then
                call wake_task(task); \* to verify eventually_terminate

                set_result_future1: result_future[pid] := "Ready";
            else
                call wake_task(task - (TASK_NUM \div 2));

                set_result_future2:
                    wake_other[task] := TRUE;
                    result_future[pid] := "Pending";
            end if;
        else
            call wake_task(task + (TASK_NUM \div 2));
            set_result_future3: result_future[pid] := "Ready";
        end if;

    end_future:
        return;
end procedure;
```

Therefore, the 2nd subject can be verified as follows.

$$
\lozenge \forall x \in 1..\mathrm{TASK\_NUM}: (\mathrm{state}[x] = \mathtt{Terminated})
$$
