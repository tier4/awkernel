\* `count` records how many times `wait` has been called.
\* `num_blocked` records the number of blocked threads.

    count = 0,

\* If `count` < N, then the thread is blocked. otherwise, all blocked threads are awakened.
\* This property implies that Barrier does not block more than N threads.

\* Note that `wait` is modeled as an atomic operation.
\* Therefore, the implementation needs to use mechanisms such as locks.
